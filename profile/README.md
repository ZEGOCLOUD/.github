## ZEGOCLOUD

Hey, this is us 👋

Our journey in audio and video hardware and software development started back in **2001**. The core team focused on key technologies in digital signals, algorithms for voice and video, as well as network transmission.🧑‍💻

We’ve learned from years of experience that delivering real-time audio and video is no easy feat.🎙🔊📹 It can only be achieved with a wealth of knowledge in many different fields. Yet in this digital era, there are so many use cases for voice and video interaction to build bridges and forge links.

So we started to explore how to share our passion for and expertise in audio and video solutions with more businesses and developers as a partner in their journey of success. That’s why we founded 🌐[**ZEGOCLOUD**](https://www.zegocloud.com) in **2015**.🚀

With **Real-Time Communication (RTC)** empowered by **AI**🧠, **[ZEGOCLOUD](https://www.zegocloud.com)** now seeks to turn the vision for **Real-Time Interaction (RTI)** into a reality. We lay the groundwork for businesses and developers to build **RTI** into their apps across mobile internet📱 and the metaverse🌌. Flexible, customizable, low code.
